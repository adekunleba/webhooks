==========================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/webhooks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jw3/webhooks)

Mixins for adding web hooks using Akka HTTP.

## Subscription API

A set of endpoints are provided to
- Subscribe (PUT)
- Unsubscribe (DELETE)
- View subscriptions (GET)

The path to the endpoints are configurable, defaulting to /hook

#### Subscribe

Params
  - `host`: String - callback hostname or ip
  - `port`: Int    - callback port number
  - `path`: String - path of callback on host
  - `body`: String - message to call back with (supports interpolation)
  - `span`: String - time to live for this hook (not implemented)
  - `method`: String - callback http method

Returns
  - `uuid`: String - id of subscription

#### Unsubscribe

Params
  - `id`: String


## Response Interpolation

The subscription can specify a body that will be used in callbacks.
The body can escape values that will be interpolated from the scope of the fired event on the server side.

todo;; example

## Hook TTL *(todo)*

Hooks can have a time to live set, which can be a length of time, number of invocations, or a composite

```"2x" | "30s" | "2x|30s"```

## Artifacts

Add a resolver to your sbt build

```resolvers += "jw3 at bintray" at "https://dl.bintray.com/jw3/maven"```

Add dependency

```"com.rxthings" %% "webhooks" % "0.5"```
